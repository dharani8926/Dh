        <p>The M5 is based on the BMW CLAR platform,[16] with strut and wishbone suspension at the front and 
            multi-link suspension at the rear. Adaptive dampers are standard equipment.
             The all-wheel-drive system (called xDrive) has the ability to decouple its front axle to make 
             the car purely rear-wheel-drive,a feature first introduced on the M4</p>
